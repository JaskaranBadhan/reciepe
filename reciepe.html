Grease its surface with 1 teaspoon oil and cover it. Keep it aside for 10 minutes to let it settle at room temperature.
                                                    Divide it into 6 equal parts and give each part a round shape (like small ball). Take one dough ball, flatten it like pattie by pressing it between your palms or against roti making board. Take 1/2 cup dry wheat flour in a plate. Coat the pattie with dry wheat flour (dry flour coating will prevent it from sticking to rolling pin and board)

                                                    Spread few drops of oil and dust flour on top surface and fold it into half-circle. Again, spread few drops of oil and dust flour on it and again fold into a triangle shaped layered pattie.
                                                    Coat it with dry flour and roll it out into triangle paratha having approx 6 inch long sides. Also, it should be thicker than phulka roti but thinner than tandoori roti/naan.
                                                    Place it on a hot tava/griddle and cook over medium flame. When tiny bubbles start to rise on the surface, flip it and reduce flame to low.

                                                    Flip it again and spread 1/2 teaspoon oil evenly on another side. Press it with spatula and cook over medium flame for 30-40 seconds. Repeat flip-press-cook process until golden brown spots appear on both sides. (do not spread oil in subsequent flip-press-cook process. Based on the size of gas burner you have, it may be required to flip 1 to 3 times to cook properly. You should look out for evenly spread golden brown spots on both sides to determine if it’s cooked or not.)
                                                    Take it away from heat and transfer to a plate. Spread butter as per your liking. Follow the same process for remaining dough balls. Serve it with curd and pickle or with paneer do pyaza.

                                                If thickened too much, add a little water to thin a bit. Heat tawa, and brush oil over it. When really hot, splash a little water over it, and immediately pour batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion.5.This will have to be very swift and will need a bit of practice.6.After spreading the batter, lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges so that it seeps under the dosa.

                                                When edges start browning a bit, pass a flat spoon under it to ease the dosa off the pan. Put desired filling in the center, and fold the two edges over.
